Animation in Processing

In this animation, a single bubble will bounce around the screen. However, it will spawn itself upon hitting the walls and the colors will eventually cycle through the rainbow.

Something mysterious will happen when the mouse is pressed (and if itâ€™s too much, you can undo the coolness by pressing a key)
